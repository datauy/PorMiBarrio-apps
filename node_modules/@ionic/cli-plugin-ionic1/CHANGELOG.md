### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ionic1:** @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic1 will no longer run `gulp sass`
upon scss file changes. The default watch patterns have also been
changed to basically only watch `www/**/*`. To continue running `gulp
sass` during `ionic serve` with this plugin, there is now a CLI plugin
just for gulp! See the changelog for details:
